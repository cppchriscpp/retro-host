# Retro Host

Simple way to host playable online versions of retro games using javascript and Github's markdown-based hosting.

Free forever.

[Click here](https://cppchriscpp.github.io/retro-host) to visit the website itself. This contains a full directory of
currently supported games.

## Contributing

A proper contributing guide is coming in the future. For now, please look into the `/games` directory, and copy a
markdown file from there to add a new game. Emulators are a little more complex, and will be explained at a future
point. If you can figure out how to do it by example, feel free to submit a PR!

## Note

Don't commit to the `/docs` directory! It's automatically generated by our continuous integration tool. 

PR to the `/games` directory, or `/emulators` for a new emu :)

## TODO

- Add circle/travis job
- rm emulators and games folders in docs, let them rebuild completely
- Show emulator license data, etc
- Hide emulators behind a "Click to play" Div
- Add more emulators
- Add more example games
- Add an index page, or a few, listing all of our games
- Show embed instructions on index page
- Link people to how to add their game, if they're interested. We want this to spread!
- Maybe: Customize the displayed page a bit better; would be nice to show game as title, lose subheading
- Show download link for rom; hopefully customizable with the skin
