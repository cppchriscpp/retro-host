# retro-host

Experimental idea for hosting retro game emulators for homebrew game developers

## Note

Don't commit to the `/docs` directory! It's automatically generated by our continuous integration tool. 

PR to the `/games` directory, or `/emulators` for a new emu :)

## TODO

- Add circle job
- rm emulators and games folders in docs, let them rebuild completely
- Show emulator license data, etc
- Hide emulators behind a "Click to play" Div
- Add more emulators
- Add more example games
- Add an index page, or a few, listing all of our games
- Show embed instructions on index page
- Link people to how to add their game, if they're interested. We want this to spread!
- Maybe: Customize the displayed page a bit better; would be nice to show game as title, lose subheading
- Show download link for rom; hopefully customizable with the skin
