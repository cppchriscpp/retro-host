## Description

Fluffy Space Escape is a new turn-based puzzle game for the original Nintendo Entertainment System.

The year is 2248. You are a rabbit that has been transported into space after a teleporter mishap. You must fight your way through space to find your way home.

A series of teleporters can get you back. These teleporters are powered by gems. However, these gems are extremely heavy! The more gems you have, the slower you are able to move.

Can you get the bunny back to earth before the end?

PS: The web-based emulator isn't that good. If you know how, please download the ROM and play it on an NES emulator, such as [Mesen](https://www.mesen.ca/) or [FCEUX](http://www.fceux.com/).
